# rakesh-portfolio — Clean Starter (Sept 2025)
**B.Tech Mechanical Engineering (AI & Robotics)** — OUTR (2025–2029)

This repository is a clean, honest starter for my learning portfolio. Historical/template content has been archived to a backup branch so the public view reflects work I actually wrote or will write myself.

---

## What’s in this repo (current — Sept 2025)
- `python_basics/hello_world.py` — a simple Python script I personally wrote to begin practicing everyday coding.  
- `notebooks/pandas_basics.ipynb` — learning notebook in progress (will be refactored to original content).  
- `ARCHIVE_NOTICE.md` — points to the `archive-raw` branch where older copied templates are preserved (if needed).

**Note:** I am intentionally keeping this repo minimal and original as I learn. I will add polished notebooks and projects as I author them.

---

## September 2025 — Completed
- Started Kaggle Python micro-course and performed hands-on exercises.  
- Authored `python_basics/hello_world.py`.  
- Published `heart-graph` as a separate small experiment repository.  
- Cleaned & archived previous template content to preserve history and maintain honesty.

---

## October 2025 — Planned (near-term)
- Build and deploy a minimal **Streamlit demo** (Hello-World app or CSV preview) and include:
  - code + README  
  - demo GIF or public deploy link  
  - short demo video if deployable  
- Continue Math Foundations (Linear Algebra & Probability basics).  
- Convert `notebooks/pandas_basics.ipynb` into a cleaned, original notebook with explanation and examples.

---

## Project productization (standards I follow)
Every project I publish will include:
- Clean code + clear README (problem, dataset, baseline, metrics).  
- A short demo (GIF or 1–3 min video).  
- A deploy link when feasible (Streamlit/Gradio/host).  
- A simple cost note (cloud credits / estimated cost).  
This ensures work is reproducible and recruiter-friendly.

## Quick note on DSA
I have not started formal DSA/LeetCode training yet — my current focus is on Python, data handling, and small deployable projects. DSA will follow once I complete initial learning milestones.

If you want to review archived files, switch to the `archive-raw` branch. This repo will grow month-by-month with original work only.
