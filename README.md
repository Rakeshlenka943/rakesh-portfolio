# Rakesh-Portfolio — Clean Starter (Sept 2025)
**B.Tech Mechanical Engineering (AI & Robotics)** — OUTR (2025–2029)

This repository is reset to a clean, honest starter state (Sept 2025) following my personal roadmap. Old content is archived on the `archive-raw` branch if I need to recover it.

## What is here now (Sept 2025)
- `python_basics/hello_world.py` — a small file I wrote myself to show real code.
- This README (you are here).
- I will add real notebooks and projects as I build them following my roadmap.

## Short-term (Sept)
- Finish Math Foundations (Linear Algebra, Probability, basic gradients).
- Build and deploy 1 small ML mini-project (Streamlit + Docker).
- Keep DSA habit: 1 Hard + 2 Medium/week.

If you want to view the old (archived) files, switch to the `archive-raw` branch on this repo.
