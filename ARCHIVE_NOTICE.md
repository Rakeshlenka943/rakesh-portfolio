# ARCHIVE NOTICE

All previous content from this repository (before Sept 2025) is preserved on the branch rchive-raw.
I reset main to a minimal honest starter state so that the repo reflects work I personally wrote and will continue to build properly (Roadmap v2.1).

To recover old files locally:
git fetch origin
git checkout archive-raw
